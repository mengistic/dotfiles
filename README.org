* MENGISTIC's dotfiles

I use =gnu stow= to manange my dotfiles. For example, to have my Emacs
config files, you need to clone this repo to your =$HOME= directory,
then cd to the repo and run the command
#+begin_src shell
  stow emacs
#+end_src
GNU Stow will symlinks all of my Emacs configurations to appropriate places.

** Programs
Here are the programs that I use for my system:
#+begin_src shell
  sway bemenu waybar zoxide emacs foot ttf-iosevka-nerd ttf-khmer fzf lf
#+end_src

** Emacs
Make sure that the fonts =Iosevka= and =Khmer OS Siemreap= are installed.
Otherwise you can comment out the section on fonts config.

I use emacs as my editor. I try to use a few packages as
possible. One package that needed to be configured is =lsp-mode=.

#+begin_src shell
  sudo pacman -S python-lsp-server texlab
#+end_src

TODO: I will change to eglot later...
